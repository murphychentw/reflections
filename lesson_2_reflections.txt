What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When I initialize a repository, git creates metadata for files under the current working directory.

Need to initialize a repository in order to track file change histories.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is different from the working directory in that you can't change the contents of the file directly.
Staging area is different from the repository in that the files have not been tracked yet.

It makes commiting a logical unit acrossing multiple files easier.
